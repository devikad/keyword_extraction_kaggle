1. Preprocess :
  1.1 Remove duplicates
  1.2 Make test data : about 20% randomly selected
  1.3 Make a script for F1 score calculation on the dummy test data
  1.4 What to do with code fragments? Examine structure of the data in general

2. Methods to try :
  2.1 Unsupervised LDA
  2.2 Supervised LDA
  2.3 One Vs All classification (as in winner's approach)

3. Identify performance issues

4. Stuff left :
  4.1 Make train/test split
  4.2 rerun conf/supp data calculations for train
  4.3 write prediction program for test
  4.4 write f1 score program
  4.5 fiddle with conf/supp threshold values
  4.6 needs to be tested on other data
